Hand gesture is one of the method used in sign language for non-verbal communication.
It is most commonly used by deaf & dumb people who have hearing or speech problems to communicate  with normal people.
Hence in this project introduced software which presents a system prototype that is able to automatically recognize sign language to help deaf and dumb people to communicate more effectively with normal people.
Gesture recognition are the developing fields of research. By considering in mind the similarities of human hand shape with four fingers and one thumb, the software aims to present a real time system for recognition of hand gesture on basis of detection of some shape based features like orientation, Centre of mass centroid, fingers status, thumb in positions of raised or folded fingers of hand.
In this way our model will detect the real time sign gestures and detect the correct sign language as the output .

To create a model or project which can detect sign language gestures performed by deaf and dumb people then that gesture will be fed to a machine-learning algorithm performed by a neural network which is then detected by the neural network and translated on display\console so that a normal person can understand what the sign gestures meaning.

In future our model will detect or decode full sentences by gestures which will make communication  more easier. 

 Our model will be useful for many purposes. By our model we can resolve a lot of problems:-
 
• It reduce communication barrier between physically impaired (deaf and dumb) people and us. People will easily understand impaired people.

•It raise awareness about sign language in among who don’t know anything about sign language .

•Use in learning sign language .
